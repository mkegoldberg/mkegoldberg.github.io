                <p>Doris Huey was born in San Francisco, CA on March 23, 1925. She was raised with strict Chinese traditions as a kid in China Town. Her parents instilled in her a hard working spirit and was taught that nothing would be handed to her. When she was 7 years old she moved to China to run a successful hotel business with her family. Doris always knew she wanted to move back to the US. Though she had spent a larger portion of her life in China, she still felt the US was her home and that she should go back. Reluctantly, her father let her return. A few years later she met her husband, also Chinese, who was serving in the US Army. In 1947 she had her first child. With the intention of rasing a large family, she gave birth to 6 more kids in the following 10 years. Doris and her husband ran multiple family businesses together including a laundry mat and restaurant. Every child did their share to make sure the businesses and household were taken care of. Doris always believed her prosperity was dependent on the prosperity of her children.</p>

                <p>Although her husband has passed, Doris is far from being alone. She still resides in San Francisco with 5 of her children in the Bay Area and 1 in Michigan. She now has 12 grandchildren and 9 great grandchildren with another due in December. Every Friday everyone that is available goes to Doris's house for dinner and it's been a strong holding tradition that all the kids, grand-kids and great grand-kids fly from all over the country to go to her house on Christmas Eve. They cook pot-stickers, eat dinner, and exchange gifts. There's no questioning where the hard working values and giving nature of all the children come from.</p>
                
                <p>Recently, all the grandchildren flew to San Francisco and surprised Doris with a special day touring the city and visiting all her favorite places. It started with her favorite spot for dim sim,then traveling in a limo bus to Crissy Field, Musée Mécanique, Yerba Buena Carousel, and Beep's Burgers. Not a single grandchild missed the event.</p>
